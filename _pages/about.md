I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Indiana University Bloomington (IUB)](https://www.indiana.edu/), under the supervision of professor [Lei Jiang](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/jiang60/). I completed my M.S. in the department of [Intelligent Systems Engineering](https://engineering.indiana.edu/) at IUB. I completed my B.S. degree from a special pilot class in the department of Computer Science at [Shandong University](http://www.cs.en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests include: 
* Privacy-preserving machine learning [[NeurIPS'19](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/56a3107cad6611c8337ee36d178ca129-Paper.pdf), [NeurIPS'20a](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/685ac8cadc1be5ac98da9556bc1c8d9e-Abstract.html), [NeurIPS'20b](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/6244b2ba957c48bc64582cf2bcec3d04-Paper.pdf), [NeurIPS'20c](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/18fc72d8b8aba03a4d84f66efabce82e-Paper.pdf), [CCS PPMLP'20](http://sci-workshops.alipay.com/CCS2020)].
* Deep learning model compression and haredware acceleration [[CAL'18](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ca/2018/02/08540899/17D45VObpO9), [ICCAD'18](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8587764), [DATE'19](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8715195), [DATE'20](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9116494), [ICLR'20](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rygfnn4twS)].
* AI syestems for biohealth informatics [[ASP-DAC'20](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9045333), [PACT'20 best paper nomination](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3410463.3414626)].
