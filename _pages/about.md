Qian Lou is a senior research scientist at Samsung Research AI center since 2021. Prior to that, he obtained his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Intelligent Systems Engineering department at [Indiana University Bloomington (IUB)](https://www.indiana.edu/) in 2019 and 2021, respectively. His research interests include machine learning, e.g., CV and NLP model compression, and privacy-preserving machine learning based on applied cryptography, e.g., Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Multi-Party Computation. Qian is also a member of IEEE/ACM.
<!--under the supervision of professor [Lei Jiang](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/jiang60/). -->
<!--At IUB, I am also fortunate to work with [Professor Geoffrey C. Fox](https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?profile_id=203), [Professor Minje Kim](https://saige.sice.indiana.edu/), [NTU Professor Weichen Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/liu/), and [KU Professor Song Bian](https://sbian3.github.io/). 
As an intern, it's my hornor to collaborate with [Dr. Yilin Shen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yilin-shen-65a56622/) and [Dr. Hongxia Jin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongxiajin/) at Samsung Research America AI center.
-->
<!--I completed my M.S. in the department of [Intelligent Systems Engineering](https://engineering.indiana.edu/) at IUB and my B.S. degree from a special pilot class in the department of Computer Science at [Shandong University](http://www.cs.en.qd.sdu.edu.cn/).
