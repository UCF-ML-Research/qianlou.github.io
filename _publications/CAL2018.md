## Abstract
Nanopore sequencing is one of the most promising genome sequencing technologies because of its ability to produce ultra long reads and provide portability. Basecalling, the most time-consuming step in the whole flow of Nanopore genome sequencing, translates analog signals to digital DNA symbols. The state-of-the-art basecaller relies on a complex neural network consisting of convolutional, long short-term memory and fully-connected layers, and a CTC decoder. Existing neural network portable accelerators achieve low basecalling throughput per Watt when processing such neural network inferences. In this paper, we propose BRAWL, a portable B asecalling-in-memory architecture, to translate RAW electrical signaLs to digital DNA symbols in SOT-MRAMs for Nanopore portable sequencers. Compared to state-of-the-art accelerators, BRAWL improves basecalling throughput per Watt by 3.88\times.
