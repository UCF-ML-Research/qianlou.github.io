## Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely adopted in object recognition, speech processing and machine translation, due to their extremely high inference accuracy. However, it is challenging to compute massive computationally expensive convolutions of deep CNNs on traditional CPUs and GPUs. Emerging Nanophotonic technology has been employed for on-chip data communication, because of its CMOS compatibility, high bandwidth and low power consumption. In this paper, we propose a nanophotonic accelerator, HolyLight, to boost the CNN inference throughput in datacenters. Instead of an all-photonic design, HolyLight performs convolutions by photonic integrated circuits, and process the other operations in CNNs by CMOS circuits for high inference accuracy. We first build HolyLight-M by microdisk-based matrix-vector multipliers. We find analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) seriously limit its inference throughput per Watt. We further use microdisk-based adders and shifters to architect HolyLight-A without ADCs. Compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based accelerator, HolyLight-A improves the CNN inference throughput per Watt by 13Ã— with trivial accuracy degradation.
